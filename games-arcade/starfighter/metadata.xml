	<longdescription>In the year 2579, the intergalactic weapons corporation, WEAPCO, has dominated the galaxy. Guide Chris Bainfield and his friend Sid Wilson on their quest to 
liberate the galaxy from the clutches of WEAPCO. Along the way, you will encounter new foes, make new allies, and assist local rebels in strikes against the evil corporation.

Originally developed by Parallel Realities in 2003, Project: Starfighter is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up space game, released under the GNU GPL. Consisting of 26 engaging levels 
spanning four planetary systems, this classic game will entertain for hours.

Unfortunately, the original Project: Starfighter used images, sound effects, and music which were not properly licensed. As such, this version of the game replaces those art assets with 
libre art assets.</longdescription>
